## Introduction

Unit tests are fitness tests for individual parts of a software program, the
part here being the smallest possible testable component. The farther down the
lifecycle of a product/service a bug is discovered, the greater the cost of
fixing it. Unit testing code provides one means to ensure any product/system
is tested early enough in the development lifecycle and so reduces the cost in
the long run.

Unit testing is limited to testing the smallest possible part in the code -
could be a simple class or even a really small group of classes with high
cohesion. Other types of automated tests such as integrations tests that span
multiple layers of the system, while though invaluable are not considered as
unit tests. The scope of the document is limited to guidelines around unit
testing only.

## Best Practices

Following are some of the good practices that are applicable regardless of the
development style in place - TDD or otherwise.

### Focused Tests

Ensure the tests are against a very specific behavior of the unit in question,
try to have one logical assertion per test and avoid repeated assertions in
many tests.

### Isolated Tests

Make each test completely independent of other tests in the test suite. Use
isolation frameworks to mock/stub out all external dependencies to the subject
under test.

Isolate the tests such that:

1. There is no assumption on the order in which the tests are run
2. Failures in one tests should not result in failure of another test.
3. There is no interdependency between tests, intentional or otherwise.

### Consistent naming

Choose a consistent naming convention for the tests that will reflect
**subject** under test, the **behavior** that is being verified and **result**
that is expected. For example in a Counter unit test, a possible test name
could be **shouldIncreaseCountByOneWhenTicked**. Whatever be the style, make
sure that it is consistent across your test suite and a look at the test
reports should tell you what is tested and what is not.

## Integrate with a build system

If the focus of the unit tests is to ensure better quality of your
product/system, then it is imperative that these tests are part of a
continuous build system. While all unit tests should be run and found to be
passing prior to being merged into and branches where other team members are
working, deployment processes in place should ensure that all tests are passed
prior to deployments.

### Fix failures

Have a process in place to notify the primary developers of the system in case
of a failure in the tests. Ensuring that all tests are repaired to pass
whenever they are found to be broken is key to having a successful unit testing
culture.

### Deterministic tests

A key characteristic of a good automated test suite is determinism. Ensure that
tests do not provide false positives or false negatives. Flaky tests if any
should be sufficiently quarantined and processes should be put in place to
ensure that these tests are made deterministic as early as possible.

### Test Coverage, Measurements, and Goals

While the specific Unit Test Coverage goals will be highly dependent on the
team & codebase, the act of measuring Unit Test Coverage in a continuous way,
and monitoring how you are performing against your team goals is a recommended
best practice.

In general all teams should operate under the minimum rule of "Leave the unit
testing coverage better than you found it".
