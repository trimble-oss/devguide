Open Source Software (OSS) can be one of the greatest assets to any product
development team, when used correctly-- you can move faster and make smarter
products by leveraging the effort of hundreds of thousands of developers who
are opening up and sharing their IP.

...However, if used incorrectly, you do risk getting yourself into a situation
where you technically have given up ownership of the IP of the software that
you create.

For this reason, Trimble has a [Comprehensive Open Source Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abJNdcwWrpIyTTHsySMi3eyzLcY70zAX/view),
that you should reference and live by as you take advantage of world of open
source software.
