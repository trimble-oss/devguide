## Guidelines for Project Owner

The owner should create an **_Epic_** on a Jira project or equivalent issue management system with a label **trimble-innersource**. This Epic will be used to create tasks when someone finds any issues in this project or has improvement suggestions.

## Guidelines for Issue Reporters

Any issues found in the project should be reported as an issue under the Epic

- The report should have a clear description of the issue and expectations
- If required, add some screenshot
- Mention about the environment and steps to reproduce

> It is highly recommended to specify business impact of the issue, As this will helps the owner to prioritize

## Action on Issues

- Owner checks with an existing ticket for possibilities of duplication
- Project Owner will prioritize the issue if required will touch base with a reporter for more clarification and business impact
- Owner assigns priority
- Owner tracks the issue and close when it fixed
