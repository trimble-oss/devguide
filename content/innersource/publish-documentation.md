Opening up a project to InnerSource is one thing, but it is equally important to get users to adopt and contribute to it. It is therefore highly advisable that you have a way of publishing the project and making the InnerSource documentation available.

Trimble maintains a list of projects which have been InnerSourced across the company. You can find the current list on the Engineering @ Trimble website [here](https://sites.google.com/trimble.com/engineering/how-we-develop/innersource-shared-components).

If you would like to have your InnerSource project included here then please contact [Matthew Dexter](mailto:matthew_dexter@trimble.com).

There are a couple of ways in which you can publish the documentation itself. 

This website including the InnerSource guidelines is built from Markdown files which are published to a website using an application
called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This is an easy tool to get started with and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines.

There are also a number of alternative options which can be used to generate websites from Markdown, you can find a list of tools [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/)

You can also render Markdown files into Atlassian Confluence. 

The MEP group in Trimble have developed a macro for Confluence which is deployed to the e-Tools Confluence instance and which can be used to very quickly
get your documentation published if it is stored in BitBucket. You can find more details on the MEP InnerSource website [here](https://confluence.trimble.tools/display/MEPG/MEP+InnerSource?file=raw/Guidelines/Publish_documentation_on_confluence.md).
