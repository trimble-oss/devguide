Opening up a project to InnerSource is one thing, but it is equally important to get users to adopt and contribute to it. It is therefore highly advisable that you have a way of publishing the project and making the InnerSource documentation available.

Trimble maintains a list of projects which have been InnerSourced across the company. You can find the current list on the [Engineering @ Trimble website](https://sites.google.com/trimble.com/engineering/how-we-develop/innersource-shared-components).

If you would like to have your InnerSource project included here then please contact {{< cloak-email address="matthew_dexter@trimble.com" display="Matthew Dexter" >}}.

There are a couple of ways in which you can publish the documentation itself.

This website including the InnerSource guidelines is built from Markdown files which are published to a website using an application
called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This is an easy tool to get started with and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines.

There are also a number of alternative options which can be used to generate websites from Markdown, you can find a list of tools on the [Markdown tools page](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/)

You can also render Markdown files into Atlassian Confluence.

The MEP group in Trimble have developed a macro for Confluence which is deployed to the e-Tools Confluence instance and which can be used to very quickly
get your documentation published if it is stored in BitBucket. You can find more details on the [MEP InnerSource website](https://confluence.trimble.tools/display/MEPG/MEP+InnerSource?file=raw/Guidelines/Publish_documentation_on_confluence.md).

For more information about this macro please contact  {{< cloak-email address="matthew_dexter@trimble.com" display="Matthew Dexter" >}}.
