It is very important to set up a method of communication for existing contributors and people who want to contribute.

Recommended would be either a Google Chat room or group or GitHub discussions.

## Google Chat

For a Google Chat room you can pre-subscribe all the group members by inviting their group email address to the chat room. Please remember to uncheck the email notification option.

See [Google Chat Help](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7653881?hl=en&ref_topic=7649113) for more details.

## Google Groups

To set up a Google Group, go to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/my-groups) and choose Create Group and follow the wizard. All Trimble groups have an associated email address which always ends in -ug@trimble.com.

See [Google Chat Help](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2464926?hl=en&ref_topic=2458761) for more details on using Google Groups

## GitHub discussions

GitHub discussions can be enabled from the repository settings screen if you have the appropriate permissions to do so. For more details see [GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)

------

Remember to publish details about how to join a chat or group in the `README.md` for your project.

For Google Chat you can publish a link to the chat from the address bar. Assuming you have pre-subscribed as above, then anyone clicking on the link will be automatically subscribed to the chat.

For Google Groups you can publish a link by right-clicking on the group email address in Google Groups and choosing Copy link address.
