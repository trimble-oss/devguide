In order to keep an easy-to-read, consistent and aesthetically pleasing look to the Trimble code, the following coding style guide is advised.

## Reference Code Standard

- [Linux Kernel Style Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html)

  - Concise
  - Covers common C issues: portability, typedefs, gotos and pointer usage

## Exceptions to the Standard

None. Any further exceptions that would benefit a project should be documented along with a rationale for the exception.

## Implementing and enforcing the Standard
