In order to keep an easy-to-read, consistent and aesthetically pleasing look to the Trimble code, the following coding style guide is advised.

## Reference Code Standard

- [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

  - Modern
  - Provides good rationale for decisions, including even counter-arguments
  - Exceptions to the code style allowed to maintain local consistency in existing code

## Exceptions to the Standard

None. Exceptions that would benefit a specific project should be documented along with a rationale for the exception.

## Implementing the Standard

| Tools/Procedures | Type                       | In Use By | Notes                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cpplint.py       | Open Source                | Tekla     | Validates Google code style. It can be modified to account for any exceptions we add to the original standard. |
| SonarQube        | Open Source and Commercial | Tekla     | Continuous Inspection, centralization of quality, DevOps integration, detection of tricky issues.              |
| clang-format     | Free                       | Tekla     | Formats source code according to style guide.                                                                  |
| Peer reviews     |                            | SketchUp  | Validates of code style, code quality.                                                                         |
