## Reference Code Standard

[Google’s Swift Style Guide](https://google.github.io/swift/), This style guide is based on Apple’s excellent Swift standard library style and also incorporates feedback from usage across multiple Swift projects within Google. It is a living document and the basis upon which the formatter is implemented.

## Exceptions to the Standard

Triple slash (///) for documentation comments is not enforced.

## Implementing the Standard

Because Swift is a relatively new language it’s easier and less time consuming to enforce formatting in the Git pre-commit hook so that it automatically formats added and modified files, for a working example see [this repo](https://bitbucket.trimble.tools/projects/SU/repos/mobile_tools/browse).
